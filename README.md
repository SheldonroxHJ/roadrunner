Improve Traffic and Road Quality and Emergency Response using existing navigation systems and Dashboard Cameras.

The below points are the idea for the realization of the above objective.
Create a Application considering all mobile platforms where the data is shared to the server.
  1. Using the existing Navigation systems, find the sudden movements in the vehicle, when the vehicle enters a pothole or inclines a            speedbreakers or accidents using the device's inbuilt sensor's spike change.
  2. Classify the changes into their fields like accident or speedbreakers or a pothole.
  3. Also, further improvements can be done to detect vehicle tilt towards a side and if,includes jerking, then can be classified as            punctures or low air pressure and alert the user. If false alert, then it must be road banking and can be reported to navigation            systems to further alert the users
  4. Incase of accidents. immediately report to a nearest hospital or raise an alarm in case of no network coverage area.
  5. Incase of speedbreakers, report to navigataion systems to unflag it as traffic block fromtheir live trafiic status.
  6. Incase of speedbumps, report it to navigation systems to alert users about the potholes and high potholes road could be not suggested      as a route to other users.
